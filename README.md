# Seasonal-Bloom
This is a website which shows the names of the flowers of the current season and can help you learn more about them.
The flowers are from a list of 32 elements assigned to respective seasons so if you are missing your flower it is because we need to fit it in a QR code.
NOTE: The flower names are random though you may need to refresh the website if the flower names repeat.
Also remember you can learn more about them by clicking the link:)
Hope you like flowers!!
